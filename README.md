# Fitts-Law

For this project, a simple interface to test Fitts' Law is build
* For this experiment, usersâ€™ abilities to point and click on random circles shown on the screen for different value of the
index of difficulty (ID) while using a Mouse or a Trackpad is measured.



Three circles is considered with diameters (small, medium, and large), 2 distances (short, long) from
the initial position of the cursor which should be at the center of the screen and two directions (left, right).
Each task consists of presenting a random combination of (diameter, distance, direction) on the screen and having the participant click on the circle as fast as they can. The following as sample tasks:

* Sample task 1: Small circle, long distance to the right

* Sample task 2: Large circle, short distance to the left
																																																							

* For each trial, the cursor will begin at the center of the screen. A user would have to move the cursor towards a circle and click on the circle.
* A triple (diameter, distance, direction) defines a single task. All 12 distinct tasks define as testing block. A single participant must complete 10 testing blocks for a total of 120 trials.
* Time of completion for each trial is recorded, the actual distance travelled for each trial and
the errors in each trial. Errors are instances where the user did not click inside of the circle.
